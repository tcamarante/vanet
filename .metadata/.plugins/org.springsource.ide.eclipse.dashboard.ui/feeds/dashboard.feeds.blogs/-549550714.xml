    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud"&gt;Spring Cloud&lt;/a&gt; 1.0.0.M3 is available now in the repo.spring.io repository. The following projects all had a 1.0.0.M3 release:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring Cloud Config: centralized key-value (or YAML) configuration management. Now supports the config server being fully embedded in another application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring Cloud Netflix. Also has better support for embeddability of the server components. Now also properly records load balancer statistics in Ribbon-enabled Spring &lt;code&gt;RestTemplate&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring Cloud for Amazon Web Services. Has new Spring Boot integration points, externalizing configuration for AWS metadata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring Cloud Security: super simple OAuth2 in a declarative style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring Cloud Bus: broadcasts framework-level events to Spring Cloud components. Big news here is that we now have a &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-bus/tree/master/spring-cloud-bus-turbine"&gt;RabbitMQ-based aggregator&lt;/a&gt; for Hystrix metrics (based on Turbine 2), so you don't have to rely on having direct HTTP access to all service instances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring Cloud CLI: Groovy CLI for writing microservices in self-contained scripts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring Cloud for Cloud Foundry: now bridges between Spring Cloud Security and Cloud Foundry service bindings, making it super easy to do Single Sign On and OAutth2 protected resources in Cloud Foundry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these modules now depend on Spring Boot 1.2.0.RC2 with the intention that we move to 1.2.0.RELEASE when it becomes available. Together with the starters (dependency management helpers, also released now at 1.0.0.M3) these represent almost all of Spring Cloud, with the exception of Spring Cloud Connectors, which should see a 1.1.1 release soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are making good progress towards a release candidate for 1.0.0 in December, and would like to thank the community for contributing on github and getting involved by trying out the early milestones.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Egads! Can you believe it's already almost the end of the year? Time has been screaming fast! It's the week of Thanksgiving for those of us in the United States. This is a wonderful time of year to sit back, find a nice &lt;a href="http://spring.io/guides"&gt;Spring IO guide&lt;/a&gt; or blog to read, and then build something awesome.. oh, and it's an ideal time to spend in the company of friends and family and to reflect on those and that for which we're grateful. I'm sure I speak for the Spring team and Pivotal at large when I say that we're grateful for you, our inspiring community, users and customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want something to read, too, we have quite a roundup this week! So, without further ado..!&lt;/p&gt;

Hurrah! This release has been a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time in coming, and I hope you'll check it out! Artem Bilan Gary Russell have done an &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; job bringing this API to fruition. Check the blog for a list of resources you can consult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Spring XD co-lead Dr. Mark Pollack just announced &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2014/11/19/spring-xd-1-1-m1-and-1-0-2-released"&gt;Spring XD 1.1.M1 and 1.0.2&lt;/a&gt;. 1.1 is marching towards GA and offers support for Apache Spark, Python, Apache Kafka, improved HDFS sink functionality, LDAP authentication, Java configuraton, Redis and JDBC sources, and Zookeeper. And that's just for starters! The good doctor briefly hints at what'll be coming in the next pre-1.1 release! Read the blog for more and for details on what's available in 1.0.2!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; ZeroTurnaround's Adam Koblentz and I did a wbinar introducing &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2014/11/24/webinar-replay-spring-boot-and-jrebel-6-0"&gt;how to use Spring Boot and JRebel to reduce iteration time&lt;/a&gt; with reloadable classes.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Our pal Simon Maple over at &lt;a href="http://zeroturnaround.com"&gt;ZeroTurnaround&lt;/a&gt; put together this look at how to quickly build &lt;a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/what-you-can-build-for-free-in-2-hours-with-spring-boot-twitter-and-facebook/"&gt;a Spring Boot application that talks to Facebook, quickly&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jacob Severson over on the &lt;em&gt;Object Partners&lt;/em&gt; blog has a great post on &lt;a href="http://www.objectpartners.com/2014/11/18/udp-server-with-spring-boot-and-reactor/"&gt;using the Reactor project (and Spring Boot) to build a UDP service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we head into the Thanksgiving holiday here where we'll load up on Turkey and then binge-watch Netflix, remember that new estimates suggest that &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/11/netflix-takes-up-9-5-of-upstream-traffic-on-the-north-american-internet/"&gt;Netflix takes up 9.5% of &lt;em&gt;upstream&lt;/em&gt; traffic on the North American internet&lt;/a&gt;. Don't even ask about &lt;em&gt;downstream&lt;/em&gt;! To learn about the microservice stack (including Spring and, increasingly, Spring Boot) that Neflix uses to scale and to learn how to integrate it all with Spring Cloud, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPtlZLdm7Nc"&gt;check out this webinar that I delivered a few months ago&lt;/a&gt;! Once the turkey's done, then come the &lt;em&gt;sales&lt;/em&gt;! China just celebrated a similarly major shopping event where one online e-tailer, Alibaba, raked in $9.3 &lt;em&gt;BILLION&lt;/em&gt; in sales in one day building atop Spring. I wrote about their crazy scale in a blog a last year, &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2013/03/04/spring-at-china-scale-alibaba-group-alipay-taobao-and-tmall/"&gt;Spring at China scale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you&lt;/em&gt; and happy Thanksgiving!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Spring Boot, the new convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring's flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development not just fly, but pleasant! Spring Boot gives you a huge leg up over normal starter projects, now let's give you another boost by adding JRebel. With JRebel, the average Java developer saves over 1 work-month per year by using JRebel to skip rebuild, restart, and redeploys of their application. JRebel 6 launches on November 4, 2014 and includes complete Spring Boot integration. Join Spring's Josh Long and ZeroTurnaround's Adam Koblentz and learn how to combine Boot with JRebel and get more done, in less time with less configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As data-driven applications become ubiquitous, the services that provide the data are proliferating. As teams become responsible for more and more of these services, it becomes critical that they be designed and implemented in a way that is as lightweight as possible. This session will cover how to design micro-services as RESTful APIs and implement them with minimal code using Spring Boot. It will focus on API design using REST and HATEOAS, with live coding progressing from a tweet-length implementation all the way to a full-fledged app running in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Along the way we'll see how to leverage technologies such as Spring Boot and Reactor to develop microservices targeted at Cloud Foundry.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaker: Matt Stine &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slides: &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/developing-microservices-for-paas-with-spring-and-cloud-foundry"&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/developing-microservices-for-paas-with-spring-and-cloud-foundry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marc Andressen has famously said "Software is eating the world." What does that mean? We take it to mean that multiple industries with historically entrenched leaders are being disrupted by businesses built around a software core. These software factories are characterized by: tight feedback loops rapid iteration horizontal scaling mobile-first UX continuous delivery These factors have contributed to drive a change in how we approach infrastructure, which has taken the lead in adapting to meet these needs with the move to the cloud, and Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings like Cloud Foundry have raised the level of abstraction to a focus on an ecosystem of applications and services. However, most applications are still developed as if we're living in the previous generation of both business and infrastructure: the monolithic application. Microservices - small, loosely coupled applications that follow the Unix philosophy of ""doing one thing well"" - represent the application development side of enabling rapid, iterative development, horizontal scale, polyglot clients, and continuous delivery. They also enable us to scale application development and eliminate long term commitments to a single technology stack. While microservices are simple, they are certainly not easy. It's recently been said that "microservices are not a free lunch." Interestingly enough, if you look at the concerns typically expressed about microservices, you'll find that they are exactly the challenges that a PaaS is intended to address. So while microservices do not necessarily imply cloud (and vice versa), there is in fact a symbiotic relationship between the two, with each approach somehow compensating for the limitations of the other, much like the practices of eXtreme Programming do the same. This session will describe architectural patterns for developing microservices: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Service Decomposition &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;API Gateways&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Stateless / Shared-Nothing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Apps Configuration and Backing Service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Consumption &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fault Tolerance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Along the way we'll see how to leverage technologies such as Spring Boot and Reactor to develop microservices targeted at Cloud Foundry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spring Trader application was debuted at SpringOne 2GX in 2012 and presented an application that demonstrates a multitude of Pivotal Application Fabric components working together – tcServer, RabbitMQ, SQLFire and Gemfire. In this session we will take that application and make (a few) modifications (mostly to config) to get it running on the same components in the cloud, specifically on the Cloud Foundry PaaS. We’ll show you how to use the Spring Cloud project to configure the deployment, how to leverage a cloud services catalog, how to implement a cross-site scripting solution (and why), how to do session state caching and we’ll discuss (the dangers of) auto reconfiguration. If you bring a laptop you can have your own instance of the app running by the end of the session.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Spring community,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we promised in the Release Candidate &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2014/10/31/spring-integration-java-dsl-1-0-rc1-released"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;,
we are pleased to announce that the Spring Integration Java DSL 1.0 GA is now available.
As usual, use the &lt;a href="http://repo.springsource.org/release"&gt;Release Repository&lt;/a&gt; with Maven or Gradle,
or download a
&lt;a href="http://repo.spring.io/release/org/springframework/integration/spring-integration-java-dsl/1.0.0.RELEASE"&gt;distribution archive&lt;/a&gt;,
to give it a spin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the project &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration-java-dsl/wiki/Spring-Integration-Java-DSL-Reference"&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt;
for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, we are glad to share with you that on Nov 12, 2014, &lt;a href="http://dzone.com/research/guide-to-enterprise-integration"&gt;DZone research&lt;/a&gt;
recognized Spring Integration as the leader in the ESB / Integration framework space, leading with 42% marketshare,
in a publication of their recent survey results.
And the report is the most popular DZone Guide in November, with more than 12 000 downloads already! Don't miss it: very
exciting. We hope the release of the Spring Integration Java DSL adds more excitement!.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to all contributors, including several who are new to the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The release includes just a few bug fixes, since the release candidate, and a lot of JavaDocs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not specifically related to the the release, I want to present here some resources on
the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are observing many valuable DSL questions on &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-integration"&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://spring.io/team/jlong"&gt;Josh Long&lt;/a&gt;'s

together Spring Boot, REST, Spring Integration 4.1 WebSocket support and Spring Integration Java DSL plus Java 8
features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Jdbc Splitter&lt;/code&gt; implementation in the project
&lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration-java-dsl/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/integration/dsl/test/jdbc/JdbcTests.java"&gt;tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/artembilan/9bd32f5e899ef293b6c2"&gt;gist&lt;/a&gt; to demonstrate how we can use &lt;a href="https://github.com/reactor/reactor"&gt;Reactor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;Stream&lt;/code&gt;s together with the Spring Integration Java DSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://spring.io/team/dsyer"&gt;Dave Syer&lt;/a&gt; has started to use Spring Integration Java DSL in the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-bus"&gt;Spring Cloud Bus&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't miss the &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration-samples/tree/master/dsl/si4demo"&gt;si4demo&lt;/a&gt; to
see the evolution of Spring Integration including the Java DSL, as shown at the 2014 SpringOne/2GX Conference. (Video should be available soon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especial thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bijukunjummen"&gt;Biju Kunjummen&lt;/a&gt; who has done some nice articles on DZone to introduce Spring Integration Java DSL: &lt;a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/spring-integration-java-dsl"&gt;http://java.dzone.com/articles/spring-integration-java-dsl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/spring-integration-java-dsl-0"&gt;http://java.dzone.com/articles/spring-integration-java-dsl-0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, with the latest &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2014/11/19/spring-xd-1-1-m1-and-1-0-2-released"&gt;Spring XD&lt;/a&gt;, we
can build Modules based on &lt;code&gt;@Configuration&lt;/code&gt; including Spring Integration Java DSL &lt;code&gt;IntegrationFlow&lt;/code&gt; definitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just after this announcement I'm going to publish a &lt;code&gt;DSL Tutorial&lt;/code&gt; to explain concepts and features using the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration-samples/tree/master/dsl/cafe-dsl"&gt;Java DSL version of the Cafe Demo&lt;/a&gt; sample as material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, we look forward to your comments and feedback (&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com"&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; 
(&lt;code&gt;spring-integration&lt;/code&gt; tag), &lt;a href="https://jira.spring.io/browse/INTEXT"&gt;Spring JIRA&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration-java-dsl/issues"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;) and we very much welcome

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I want to look at - and demonstrate - some of the &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; new features in &lt;a href="http://spring.io/projects/spring-boot"&gt;Spring Boot 1.2&lt;/a&gt; that make the lives of those coming from, or otherwise building on, Java EE easier.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's worth mentioning that a lot of this support has been possible with Spring before, of course, but now with Spring Boot 1.2, it's just so darned easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, here's an example program with notes after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight highlight-java"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smp"&gt;demo&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;org.glassfish.jersey.jackson.JacksonFeature&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;org.glassfish.jersey.server.ResourceConfig&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;org.springframework.jms.annotation.JmsListener&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;org.springframework.jms.core.JmsTemplate&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;javax.annotation.PostConstruct&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;javax.inject.Inject&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;javax.inject.Named&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;javax.jms.JMSException&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;javax.persistence.*&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;javax.transaction.Transactional&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;javax.ws.rs.*&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;java.io.Serializable&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;java.util.Collection&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;java.util.logging.Logger&lt;/span&gt;;

@&lt;span class="pl-stj"&gt;SpringBootApplication&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;Application&lt;/span&gt; {

        &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;JerseyConfig&lt;/span&gt;() {
            &lt;span class="pl-v"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;register(&lt;span class="pl-stj"&gt;GreetingEndpoint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;class);
            &lt;span class="pl-v"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;register(&lt;span class="pl-stj"&gt;JacksonFeature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;class);
        }
    }

    &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-st"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="pl-st"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;[] &lt;span class="pl-v"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;) {
        &lt;span class="pl-stj"&gt;SpringApplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;run(&lt;span class="pl-stj"&gt;Application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;class, args);
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complete  code listings, including the very sparce &lt;a href="https://github.com/joshlong/techtips/blob/master/examples/jaxrs-jta-jms-jpa-330-250-undertow/src/main/resources/application.properties"&gt;&lt;code&gt;application.properties&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/joshlong/techtips/blob/master/examples/jaxrs-jta-jms-jpa-330-250-undertow/pom.xml"&gt;Maven build&lt;/a&gt;, are available online. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;a id="user-content-jax-rs-with-jersey" class="anchor" href="#jax-rs-with-jersey" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;JAX-RS with Jersey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example &lt;a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-jersey"&gt;demonstrates Boot's new JAX-RS auto-configuration&lt;/a&gt; (in this case, using &lt;a href="https://jersey.java.net/"&gt;Jersey 2.x&lt;/a&gt;) in the &lt;code&gt;GreetingEndpoint&lt;/code&gt;. Note how convenient it is to get it all working! The only thing to be weary of is that you need to specify a &lt;code&gt;ResourceConfig&lt;/code&gt; subclass to let Jersey know which components to register.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;a id="user-content-global-transactions-with-jta" class="anchor" href="#global-transactions-with-jta" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Global Transactions with JTA&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It demonstrates global transactions with the &lt;a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-jta"&gt;new auto-configured JTA support&lt;/a&gt;. JTA is a Java API for the X/Open XA protocol which lets multiple, compliant, transaction resources (like a message queue and a database) participate in a single transaction. To do this, we've used the &lt;a href="http://www.atomikos.com/"&gt;Atomikos&lt;/a&gt; standalone JTA provider. We could have as easily used Bitronix, as well; both are auto-configured if you bring the appropriate starter along. In this example, in the &lt;code&gt;GreetingService&lt;/code&gt;, JMS and JPA work is done as part of a global transaction. We demonstrate this by creating 3 transactions and simulating a rollback on the third one. You should see printed to the console that there are two records that come back from the JDBC &lt;code&gt;javax.sql.DataSource&lt;/code&gt; data source and two records that are received from the embedded JMS &lt;code&gt;javax.jms.Destination&lt;/code&gt; destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;a id="user-content-the-undertow-embedded-web-server" class="anchor" href="#the-undertow-embedded-web-server" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Undertow embedded web-server&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example also uses the Wildfly (from RedHat) application server's &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://undertow.io/"&gt;Undertow embedded HTTP server&lt;/a&gt; instead of (the default) Apache Tomcat. It's as easy to use Undertow as it is to use Jetty or Tomcat - just exclude &lt;code&gt;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-tomcat&lt;/code&gt; and add &lt;code&gt;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-undertow&lt;/code&gt;! This contribution originated as a third-party PR - thanks Ivan Sopov! It's awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;a id="user-content-odds-and-ends" class="anchor" href="#odds-and-ends" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Odds and Ends&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just for consistency, the example also uses JSR 330. JSR 330 describes a set of annotations that you can use in proprietary application servers like WebLogic as well as in a portable manner in dependency injection containers like Google Guice or Spring. I also use a JSR 250 annotation (defined as part of Java EE 5) to demonstrate lifecycle hooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example relies on a Spring Boot &lt;a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.2.0.RC2/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-configure-a-datasource"&gt;auto-configured and embedded&lt;/a&gt;, in-memory &lt;a href="http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html"&gt;H2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;javax.sql.DataSource&lt;/code&gt; and - a Spring Boot &lt;a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.2.0.RC2/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-hornetq"&gt;auto-configured and embedded&lt;/a&gt;, in-memory &lt;a href="http://hornetq.jboss.org"&gt;HornetQ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;javax.jms.ConnectionFactory&lt;/code&gt;. If you wanted to connect to traditional, non-embedded instances, it's straightforward to either specify properties in &lt;code&gt;application.yml&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;application.properties&lt;/code&gt; like &lt;code&gt;spring.hornetq.host&lt;/code&gt; or simply define &lt;code&gt;@Bean&lt;/code&gt;s of the appropriate type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; uses the new &lt;code&gt;@SpringBootApplication&lt;/code&gt; annotation which combines &lt;code&gt;@Configuration&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@EnableAutoConfiguration&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@ComponentScan&lt;/code&gt;. Nice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;a id="user-content-deployment" class="anchor" href="#deployment" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Deployment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though this example uses a lot of fairly familiar Java EE APIs, this is still just typical Spring Boot, so by default you can run this application using &lt;code&gt;java -jar ee.jar&lt;/code&gt; or easily deploy it to process-centric &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service"&gt;platforms-as-a-service&lt;/a&gt; offerings like - Heroku or &lt;a href="http://cloudfoundry.org"&gt;Cloud Foundry&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to deploy it to a standalone application server like (like Apache Tomcat, or Websphere, or anything in between), it's straightforward to convert the build into a &lt;code&gt;.war&lt;/code&gt; and deploy it accordingly to any Servlet 3 container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you deploy the application to a more classic application server, Spring Boot can take advantage of the AS's facilities, instead. For example, it's dead-simple to consume a JNDI-bound &lt;a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-jms-jndi"&gt;JMS &lt;code&gt;ConnectionFactory&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-connecting-to-a-jndi-datasource"&gt;JDBC &lt;code&gt;DataSource&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#_using_a_java_ee_managed_transaction_manager"&gt;JTA &lt;code&gt;UserTransaction&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;a id="user-content-spring-boot-12-choice-and-power" class="anchor" href="#spring-boot-12-choice-and-power" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spring Boot 1.2: Choice &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Power&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, personally, would question a lot of these APIs. Do you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need distributed, multi-resource transactions? In today's &lt;a href="http://www.eaipatterns.com/ramblings/18_starbucks.html"&gt;distributed world, consider global transaction managers are an architecture smell&lt;/a&gt;. Do you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need to use JAX-RS when Spring offers a richer, integrated Spring MVC-based stack complete with MVC, REST, HATEOAS, OAuth and websockets support? JPA's a nice API for talking to a SQL-based &lt;code&gt;javax.sql.DataSource&lt;/code&gt;, but Spring Data repositories (which include support for JPA, of course, but &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; for Cassandra, MongoDB, Redis, CouchBase, and an increasingly long list of alternative technologies) reduce much of the boilerplate to a simple interface definition for the common cases. So, do you really need all of this? It might well be that you do, and - as always - the choice is yours. That's why this release is so cool! More power, more choice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;a id="user-content-what-else" class="anchor" href="#what-else" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What Else?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;, actually. There are a &lt;em&gt;slew&lt;/em&gt; of new features. I couldn't even begin to cover them all here. So I won't try. Check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-1.2-Release-Notes"&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt; for the full scoop! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring Boot 1.2 is fast approaching GA, and now's a very good time to &lt;a href="http://start.spring.io"&gt;try the bits, kick the tires&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues"&gt;file issues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spring-boot"&gt;ask questions&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, a friend of mine tweeted out a challenge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Name a framework in which you can create a new app expose a REST service with a database and deploy it to the cloud in five minutes. #grails"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment I spotted that tweet, I responded, "Spring Boot + Spring Data REST"! I realized he was kindly pointing out how easy it is to build RESTful services with Grails (a great framework). But I couldn't resist showing the ease and power of Spring Data REST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prove my point, I couldn't resisting crafting a screencast. In the linked screencast, I show how über easy Spring has made it to pick the parts for your app from &lt;a href="http://start.spring.io"&gt;http://start.spring.io&lt;/a&gt;, define your domain, and then export them as a hypermedia-driven RESTful service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

Apache Hadoop 2.2  support was removed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Running-Distributed-Mode#setting-up-zookeeper"&gt;Configurable location of Spring XD’s top level node in Zookeeper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of note for the next release of Spring XD 1.1 RC1 we will be including support for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Kafka based message bus in addition to revamped Kafka support based on the low level consumer API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modules that use &lt;a href="https://reactor.github.io/docs/api/2.0.0.M1/reactor/rx/Stream.html"&gt;Reactor’s Stream API&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processor and Sink modules that use Spark Streaming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplified module contribution based on Spring Boot&lt;/li&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to another installment of &lt;em&gt;This Week in Spring&lt;/em&gt;! This week I'm in sunny Sofia, Bulgaria for the &lt;a href="http://2014.java2days.com/"&gt;Java2Days software conference&lt;/a&gt;. As usual, this show is &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too much fun and the crowd's bigger and better than ever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://spring.io/blog/2014/11/12/spring-boot-1-2-0-rc1-available-now"&gt;Spring Boot 1.2.0 RC1 is now available&lt;/a&gt;! This release moves embedded &lt;code&gt;Servlet&lt;/code&gt; containers to Tomcat 8 or Jetty 9, adds a new &lt;code&gt;@SpringBootApplication&lt;/code&gt; annotation, adds &lt;code&gt;JavaMail&lt;/code&gt; support, and registers additional Spring Boot actuator support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://spring.io/blog/2014/11/18/spring-session-1-0-0-rc1-released"&gt;Spring Session 1.0.0.RC1 is here&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;loads&lt;/em&gt; of features!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Speaking of using Spring with ZeroTurnaround, join ZeroTurnaround's Adam Koblentz and I on Nov 20th as we look &lt;a href="http://spring.io/blog/2014/10/28/webinar-spring-boot-and-jrebel-6-0"&gt;at using JRebel and Spring Boot to deliver a one-two developer productivity punch without equal&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Want to learn more about the Reactor project and the role of asych I/O in microservices? Check out &lt;a href="http://spring.io/blog/2014/11/13/webinar-using-reactor-for-asych-non-blocking-microservices"&gt;the upcoming Reactor webinar&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/1BplAD9"&gt;Spring for Apache #Hadoop 2.1.0M2&lt;/a&gt; is now available!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://spring.io/blog/2014/11/13/spring-io-platform-1-0-3-released"&gt;Andy Wilskinson has just announced that Spring IO Platform 1.0.3&lt;/a&gt; is now available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Another great SpringOne2GX 2014 replay is up: Spring Data ninjas Thomas Darimont, Oliver Gierke, and Christoph Strobl's talk &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/1u28Vw9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What's new in Spring Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Check out the replay of our pal Venkat's talk from SpringOne2GX 2014, &lt;a href="http://spring.io/blog/2014/11/17/springone2gx-2014-replay-java-8-language-capabilities-what-s-in-it-for-you"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Java 8 Language Capabilities, What's in it for you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Splunk's Damien Dallimore SpringOne2GX 2014 talk, &lt;a href="http://spring.io/blog/2014/11/10/springone2gx-2014-replay-gaining-application-lifecycle-intelligence"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gaining Application Lifecycle Intelligence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is now available online!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slideware from SpringOne2GX 2014 is also up!  They are linked to from the session details on the &lt;a href="http://springone2gx.com"&gt;http://springone2gx.com&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our pal Simon Maple over at ZeroTurnaround just published a nice post, &lt;a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/what-you-can-build-for-free-in-2-hours-with-spring-boot-twitter-and-facebook/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What You Can Build for Free in 2 Hours with Spring Boot, Twitter, and Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simon &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; did a nice post that has him basically following the &lt;a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/blog/no-time-to-sit-back-and-rest-develop-your-restful-web-services-with-spring-boot-and-jrebel/"&gt;Spring IO guide on building REST services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You listen to the SE Radio podcast, I trust? You should. It's legit. &lt;a href="http://www.se-radio.net/2014/10/episode-213-james-lewis-on-microservices/"&gt;Check out this nice interview with James Lewis, microservice luminary, on what a microservice is&lt;/a&gt;. I think it's a pretty darned interesting discussion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking for a more non-trivial Spring and WebSocket sample backed by ActiveMQ? &lt;a href="https://github.com/BijanVan/Spring-Boot-Websocket-Sample"&gt;Check out this example&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've been loving &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqrYNdwlA8s"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Cloud Foundry After Dark&lt;/em&gt; recorded Google Hangout sessions&lt;/a&gt;. If you're not following them, this is definitely fun.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do a techtip for our e-mail newsletter, and we're going to start publishing those techtips on the blog. First up: &lt;a href="http://spring.io/blog/2014/11/15/building-a-spring-integration-4-1-websocket-endpoint"&gt;building a Spring Integration 4.1 websocket integration&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we take a look at the latest changes and new features of the Spring Tool Suite, the Eclipse-based IDE that comes packed with support for Spring, Groovy, Grails, Gradle, AspectJ, and Cloud Foundry. We dive into the new ways the tooling makes it easy and convenient to develop enterprise applications that are based on Spring Boot and how the Spring Tool Suite integrates will all the different parts of Spring IO. In addition to that we will show the Java8 language tooling that comes as part of the Spring Tool Suite and demonstrate how to get the most out of Java8 in your projects. In the second part of this presentation we take a look at our vision for how we are going to move developer tooling itself into the cloud era. We provide a sneak peek under the hood of what we are working on for the next generation of developer tooling. We will demonstrate what future cloud-based developer might look like, how real Java language tooling can look and feel when running in a browser-based code editor, and show how every developer can smoothly migrate into this new world of cloud-based developer tooling. All this is based on Flux, a new project at eclipse.org, that aims at providing new and innovative ways to move towards cloud-based tooling in a smooth, seamless way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaker: Venkat Subramaniam &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No Slides at speaker request &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a good amount of excitement about the new version of Java. The big evolution of course is the lambda expressions. In this presentation we will dive into the language features in Java 8, take a look at some of their nuances, and look at ways to put them to good use. In addition to looking at lambdas we will also dive into the Streams capabilities and also some of the features in Java 8 that make all these possible.

    <title>Building a Spring Integration 4.1 WebSocket Endpoint</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://spring.io/blog/2014/11/15/building-a-spring-integration-4-1-websocket-endpoint" />

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://www.twitter.com/starbuxman"&gt;Josh Long&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2014/11/11/spring-integration-and-amqp-releases-available"&gt;Spring Integration 4.1&lt;/a&gt; was just released and it includes a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of great new features! One of my favorites? Smart integration with the Spring 4 WebSocket support. Now you can compose a integration flow whose final destination is a WebSocket client. There is also support for acting as the client to a WebSocket service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to compile it, you will need Java 8 (we make heavy use of lambdas here) and the following Maven dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;groupId&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;code&gt;org.springframework.integration&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;artifactId&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;code&gt;spring-integration-java-dsl&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;version&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;1.0.0.RC1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;groupId&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;code&gt;org.springframework.integration&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;artifactId&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;code&gt;spring-integration-websocket&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;version&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;4.1.0.RELEASE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;groupId&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;code&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;artifactId&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;code&gt;spring-boot-starter-websocket&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;version&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;1.2.0.RC1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to resolve those dependencies you will need the &lt;a href="http://repo.spring.io/snapshot"&gt;&lt;code&gt;snapshot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://repo.spring.io/milestone"&gt;&lt;code&gt;milestone&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Maven repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All clients listening on &lt;code&gt;/names&lt;/code&gt; will receive whatever message is sent into the &lt;code&gt;requestChannel&lt;/code&gt; channel. A Spring 4 &lt;code&gt;MessageChannel&lt;/code&gt; is a named conduit - more or less analogous to a &lt;code&gt;java.util.Queue&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This example uses &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2014/10/31/spring-integration-java-dsl-1-0-rc1-released"&gt;the Spring Integration Java configuration DSL&lt;/a&gt; on top of the new  &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2014/11/11/spring-integration-and-amqp-releases-available"&gt;Spring Integration 4.1 web socket support&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s the example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight highlight-java"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smp"&gt;demo&lt;/span&gt; ;

&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;org.springframework.context.annotation.*&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;org.springframework.integration.channel.DirectChannel&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;org.springframework.integration.dsl.IntegrationFlow&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;org.springframework.integration.dsl.support.Function&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;org.springframework.integration.websocket.ServerWebSocketContainer&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;org.springframework.integration.websocket.outbound.WebSocketOutboundMessageHandler&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;org.springframework.messaging.*&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;org.springframework.messaging.simp.SimpMessageHeaderAccessor&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;org.springframework.messaging.support.MessageBuilder&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;java.util.concurrent.Executors&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;java.util.stream.Collectors&lt;/span&gt;;

                    .map(s &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-stj"&gt;MessageBuilder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;fromMessage(m)
                            .setHeader(&lt;span class="pl-stj"&gt;SimpMessageHeaderAccessor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;SESSION_ID_HEADER&lt;/span&gt;, s)
                            .build())
                    .collect(&lt;span class="pl-stj"&gt;Collectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;toList());
            f&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;split( &lt;span class="pl-stj"&gt;Message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;class, splitter)
                    .channel(c &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;executor(&lt;span class="pl-stj"&gt;Executors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;newCachedThreadPool()))
                    .handle(webSocketOutboundAdapter());
        };
    }

    &lt;span class="pl-st"&gt;@RequestMapping&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;/hi/{name}&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)
    &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-st"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="pl-st"&gt;@PathVariable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-stj"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-v"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;) {
        requestChannel()&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;send(&lt;span class="pl-stj"&gt;MessageBuilder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;withPayload(name)&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;build());
    }
}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;IntegrationFlow&lt;/code&gt; is simple. For each message that comes in, copy it and address it to each listening &lt;code&gt;WebSocket&lt;/code&gt; session by adding a header having the &lt;code&gt;SimpMessageHeaderAccessor.SESSION_ID_HEADER&lt;/code&gt;, then send it the outbound &lt;code&gt;webSocketOutboundAdapter&lt;/code&gt; which will deliver it to each listening client. To see it work, open &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href="http://localhost:8080/"&gt;http://localhost:8080/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in one browser window, and then &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href="http://localhost:8080/hi/Spring"&gt;http://localhost:8080/hi/Spring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in another. There is a simple client  &lt;a href="https://github.com/joshlong/techtips/tree/master/examples/spring-integration-4.1-websockets-example"&gt;demonstrated in this techtip's code repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is great documentation on how to use the web socket &lt;a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/docs/latest-ga/reference/html/web-sockets.html"&gt;components in Spring Integration 4.1 documentation&lt;/a&gt;. There's a more inspiring example in &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration-samples/tree/master/basic/web-sockets"&gt;the Spring Integration samples directory&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Spring for Apache Hadoop 2.1.0.M2 Released</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce the second milestone release of Spring for Apache Hadoop 2.1. The release is now available in the &lt;a href="http://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone/org/springframework/data/spring-data-hadoop/2.1.0.M2/"&gt;Spring IO repository&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of version upgrades for the 2.1.0.M2 release: Spring Framework 4.1.2, Spring Boot 1.2.0.RC1 and more. See the &lt;a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-hadoop/docs/2.1.0.M2/changelog.txt"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We updated the Kite SDK dataset support to 0.17.0 and this means there are some changes to the API. The use of a namespace in addition to the basePath is now mandatory. The &lt;code&gt;DatasetTemplate&lt;/code&gt; now also uses &lt;code&gt;ViewCallback&lt;/code&gt;s instead of a partition expression for querying the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning with the Spring for Apache Hadoop 2.1 version, we now only support Hadoop 2.0 APIs and no longer provide backwards compatibility with older Hadoop v1 distributions. If you need support for older Hadoop versions please use the 2.0.3 or 1.1.0 versions of Spring for Apache Hadoop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We provide support and "flavored" versions for the following distributions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apache Hadoop 2.4.1 (2.1.0.M2-hadoop24)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apache Hadoop 2.5.1 (2.1.0.M2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pivotal HD 2.1 (2.1.0.M2-phd21)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloudera CDH5 (2.1.0.M2-cdh5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hortonworks HDP 2.1 (2.1.0.M2-hdp21)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default distribution version is changed to be Apache Hadoop 2.5.1. We have added support for Pivotal HD 2.1 and updated the Cloudera CDH version to CDH 5.2. We will continue to update the supported versions and expect to support Apache Hadoop 2.6.0 and Hortonworks HDP 2.2 in the next  release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more project specific information please see the &lt;a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-hadoop/"&gt;project page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
